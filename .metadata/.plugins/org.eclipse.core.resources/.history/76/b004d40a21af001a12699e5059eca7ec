 * Course 605.201.81 Summer 2020
 * Module 3 Question 2
 * 
 * Application Requirements:
 * Write a program that asks a user to guess a secret number between 1 and N, where N is 
 * a positive number that the user is prompted for. The program should also prompt the user
 * for the maximum number of guesses they would like to make. Each time the player makes a 
 * guess, the program shall respond with “correct”, “too low”, or “too high”. The program 
 * should keep track of the number of guesses the user made to discover the secret number. 
 * The program should continue execution until the user has discovered the secret number or
 * has exceeded the maximum number of guesses. The program shall also allow the user to play
 * the game again until the user declines. The program should generate the magic number randomly,
 * using the built-in Java method Math.random().

	/*
     * Here is the main block of my code. 
     * 1. I will initialize all of my variables 
     * 2. I will ask the user to guess a number and I will save it to a variable
     * 3. conduct error handling
     * 4. I will ask the user for the maximum number of guesses they want and save it to a variable.
     * 5. conduct error handling
     * 6. I need to randomize a number and save it to a variable using: 
     * 	  randomNumber = (int) ( N * Math.random() ) + 1;
     * 7. i will have a do while for: quit, greater than, less than, equal (default)
